# Google Drive support for Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains custom
[`Contents`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/services/contents.js) classes that allows IPython to use
Google Drive for file management.  The code is a organized as a python package
that contains functions to install a Jupyter Notebook JavaScript extension,
and activate/deactivate different IPython profiles to be used with Google drive.

To install this package, run

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-drive.git#egg=jupyter-drive
```

This will install the package in development mode with pip, which means that any
change you make to the repository will be reflected into the importable version
immediately.

To install the notebook extension and activate your profile with Google
Drive, run

```bash
python -m jupyterdrive <profile_name>
```

Be sure that the profile exist before running the command.
You can create a new profile with

```bash
ipython profile create <profilename>
```

Please refer to IPython documentation for more info on profiles.

## Symlink files

By default all the Javascript files will be symlinked, so any update to the package python
or javascript will be reflected on your python server.
use the  `--no-symlink` option to actually copy the file on their final destination.

## Mixed contents

You can also installed the `MixedContentsManager`, to do so install as previously with
the `--mixed` options. For example on the default profile :

```bash
python -m jupyterdrive default --mixed
```

The mixed content manager will show both contents from local hard drive and remote
google drive as two directory in your dashboard.

#### mixed content configuration.

All the following files should be created automatically
once you have used the content manager once. You should
need to modify these file manually to have the contents maager working in most cases.

To modify the configuration of the mixed contents manager you need to update the following files:

`<profile_mixed>/ipython_notebook_config.json` which by default should heve the following structure :


```json
{
  "nbformat": 1,
  "NotebookApp": {
    "contents_manager_class": "jupyterdrive.mixednbmanager.MixedContentsManager",
    "tornado_settings": {
      "contents_js_source": "nbextensions/gdrive/mixed-contents"
    }
  },
  "MixedContentsManager":{
    "filesystem_scheme": [
        {
          "root":"local",
          "contents":"IPython.html.services.contents.filemanager.FileConensManager"
        },
        {
          "root": "gdrive",
          "contents": "jpyerdrive.clientsidenbmanager.ClientSideContentsManager"
        }
      ]
  }

}
```

The `root` field of `filesystem_scheme` represent the name that would be use as
virtual mount points for the contents manager in the dashbord and should be
consistent with the name given in `nbconfig/common.json` describe below.

the `contents` field contains the fully qualified name of a Contents manager to
mount on the mountpoint.

The second config file that deals with configuring the frontend should be:

```json
  {
    "schema": [
      {
        "stripjs": false,
        "contents": "services/contents",
        "root": "local"
      },
      {
        "stripjs": true,
        "contents": "./drive-contents",
        "root": "gdrive"
      }
    ]
  }
```

To modify it, in a notebook access the config object, and extract defautl value: 
`>>> data = IPython.notebook.contents.config.data` . Change one of the values, 
for example : `>>> data.mixed_contents.schema[0].root = 'new_root'`. Update teh config with the new value :
`>>> IPython.notebook.contents.config.update(data)`.


As stated previously the `root` value should match python side config file,
`contents` represent the client-side content manager that need to be use.
`stripjs` is a boolean value that indicate weather the name of the mount point
should be stripped from the various path on the javascript side before passing
it to the differents subcontent manager.



## Other options

If IPython has been installed system wide, in a virtual environment or with
some custom setup you might need to pass `--user`, `-prefix <prefix>` or
`--path <path>` option to install the extension in a user-owned profile
location.

See `python -m jupyterdrive --help` for more information.

## deactivate a profile

It is not yet possible to deactivate the drive integration automatically. But
you can get rid of `~/.ipython/profile_defaut/ipython_notebook_config.json`
config file to deactivate Google Drive as well as other config options.

The configuration of IPython/Jupyter is done through the `.json` file in the
profile situated in the profile and will take precedence on configuration done
in `.py` files, though you can still use non conflicting options.

# First launch

Launch ipython with ths profile in which you activated jupyter-drive:

```bash
ipython notebook --profile <profilename>
```

On first launch, the application will ask you for the authorization to access
your files on Google Drive.  It only asks for permission to create new files or
 access files it has created or that you manually open with this application.
It also requires permission to access file/directory metadata, in order
to display the list of files/directories in the tree view.

The request pop-up looks like the following:

![auth screenshot](img/auth.png)

Clicking ok will open a Google OAuth pop-up.  You will see that the `Jupyter
Drive` application want access to some informations about your files. Keep that
in mind if you want to revoke access at a later point.

![](img/popup.png)

Once you click `Accept` you should be able to start creating new notebooks on
Google Drive, and open existing ones created by this application, and
view files/directories in the tree view.

## Advance configuration.

The contents manager can access the `common` section of nbconfig, thus
you can set config values in `<profile_dir>/nbconfig/common.json`. The default
value that are use are the following:

```json

{"gdrive":
    {
    "METADATA_SCOPE": true,
    "FILE_SCOPE": true,
    "CLIENT_ID": "763546234320-uvcktfp0udklafjqv00qjgivpjh0t33p.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    }
}
```

The `APP_ID` section is not yet configurable, but shoudl be configurable in the
same way at some point in the future.
